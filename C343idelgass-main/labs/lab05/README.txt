Notes forâ€¦


Task A
	
Task B
	Would really have liked to separate out the logic for checking balance and determining height, but required method signature prevented this. Instead I do both at the same 	time via the use of a dummy value (-1) that returns from the heightatnode method when that node possess unbalanced subtrees.
Task C
