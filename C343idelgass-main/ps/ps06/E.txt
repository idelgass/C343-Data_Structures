The following graph has no negative cost cycle, but will still cause Dijkstra's alogorithm to fail.

     D
   /   \
  10  -10 
 /       \
A         C
 \       /
  1     1
   \   /
     B

Dijkstras's algorithm will add edges in the following order: A-B, B-C, A-D. This is incorrect as the shortest path from  A to C is not A->B->C but A->D->C (the former has a cost of 2 and the latter has a cost of 0).
